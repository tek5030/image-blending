# Lab 2: Image blending with OpenCV

Welcome to lab 2! In this lab, we are going to play with image blending using Laplacian pyramids with OpenCV.

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
Then open the lab project in CLion.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:

1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Implement image blending](lab-guide/2-implement-image-blending.md)

At an appropriate time, [our proposed solution](https://github.com/tek5030/lab_02_solution) will be made available.

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
